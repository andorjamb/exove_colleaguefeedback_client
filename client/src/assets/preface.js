Especially open comments are very appreciated.\nA few reminders:\n1) You are also evaluating your competence manager with the same form. When evaluating, please consider himher first and foremost as a manager, not through hisher specialist role. You can see the role from the preselected 'You are providing this feedback as' -question.\n 2) Project Managers are evaluating all the employees working in client projects, and are doing the evaluation from the client perspective. Remember that a PM can also be asked to give feedback as a colleague. You can see the role from the preselected 'You are providing this feedback as' -question.\n3) We have a new grading system. Please read the guide on grading carefully.\n If you haven't worked with the person in question at all, don't start guessing. Notify HR / CTO to find another respondent - and remember that suggestions of a more suitable respondent are always welcome. Don't forward the email to anyone yourself.\nPlease notice that although your feedback will be anonymous, your open comments containing any identifying information (such as project specific data) might be recognisable. We won't actively dig up who might have answered to whom, nor do we ever reveal that information to anyone.";
