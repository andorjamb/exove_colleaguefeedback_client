  "Consider the person’s performance as compared to your expectations. The scale is as follows 1-5:\n1 Performing fully below your expectations in this area\n2 Performing partially under your expectations in this area\n3 Performing on the expected level in this area. This means there’s “nothing to complain” and you are content with the performance in this area.\n4 The performance is exceeding expectations partially in this area. This means in your view the person is doing more than you think is rightly expected on the job type or level the person is currently working on.\n5 The performance is exceeding your expectations fully in this area. This means the person is performing on the next level and thus should be promoted to a higher level or to a more demanding role.\n";
